/*
 #Mutability of Collections
 */
// If you create an array, a set, or a dictionary, and assign it to a variable, the collection that is created will be mutable. This means that you can change (or mutate) the collection after it‚Äôs created by adding, removing, or changing items in the collection. If you assign an array, a set, or a dictionary to a constant, that collection is immutable, and its size and contents cannot be changed
/*
 #Arrays
 */
// Array Type Shorthand Syntax
// Array<Element>
// [Element] -> preferred
// Creating an Empty Array
var someInts = [Int]()
print("someInts is of type [Int] with \(someInts.count) items.")
// Prints "someInts is of type [Int] with 0 items."
someInts.append(3)
// someInts now contains 1 value of type Int
someInts = []
// someInts is now an empty array, but is still of type [Int]
// Creating an Array with a Default Value
var threeDoubles = Array(repeating: 0.0, count: 3)
// threeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
// Creating an Array by Adding Two Arrays Together
var anotherThreeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.5, count: 3)
// anotherThreeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
var sixDoubles = threeDoubles + anotherThreeDoubles
// sixDoubles is inferred as [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
// Creating an Array with an Array Literal
var shoppingList = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
// shoppingList has been initialized with two initial items
// Accessing and Modifying an Array
print("The shopping list contains \(shoppingList.count) items.")

let apples = shoppingList.removeLast()
// the last item in the array has just been removed
// shoppingList now contains 5 items, and no apples
// the apples constant is now equal to the removed "Apples" string

/*
 Sets
 */
// Hash Values for Set Types
// All of Swift‚Äôs basic types (such as String, Int, Double, and Bool) are hashable by default, and can be used as set value types or dictionary key types. Enumeration case values without associated values (as described in Enumeration) are also hashable by default.
// Set Type Syntax
// Set<Element>
// Unlike arrays and dictionaries, sets do not have an equivalent shorthand form
// Creating and Initializing an Empty Set
var letters = Set<Character>()
print("letters is of type Set<Character> with \(letters.count) items.")
// Prints "letters is of type Set<Character> with 0 items."
letters.insert("a")
// letters now contains 1 value of type Character
letters = []
// letters is now an empty set, but is still of type Set<Character>
// Creating a Set with an Array Literal
var favoriteGenres: Set = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
// favoriteGenres has been initialized with three initial items
// Accessing and Modifying a Set
print("I have \(favoriteGenres.count) favorite music genres.")
// Prints "I have 3 favorite music genres."
if favoriteGenres.isEmpty {
    print("As far as music goes, I'm not picky.")
} else {
    print("I have particular music preferences.")
}
// Prints "I have particular music preferences."
